  tags: "FPGA, VHDL, Bayesian Filtering, Hardware-in-the-Loop"
  description: "<strong>Awarded 1st Place (Best Project).</strong> This project successfully implemented a theoretical Bayesian filter as a high-performance, real-time system on hardware. We engineered the solution in VHDL for an FPGA to process data from low-cost ultrasonic sensors (HC-SR04), achieving significant noise reduction and validating the paper's concepts in a physical implementation."

  tags: "Machine Learning, Software Testing, Cost-Sensitive Learning, Cross-Project Classification"
  description: "This research line investigates efficient ML classifiers for software testing. Building on previous work, my contribution, <strong>'Making More with Less'</strong>, introduced cross-project, cross-language, and cost-sensitive training. This work is now being extended into a series of subsequent papers on optimizing software test outcomes."
