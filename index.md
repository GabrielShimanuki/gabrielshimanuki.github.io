<!-- ## About Me  -->

I am a Master’s student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [Polytechnic School](https://www-poli-usp-br.translate.goog/?_x_tr_sl=pt&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=pt-BR&_x_tr_pto=wapp) of the [University of São Paulo](https://www5.usp.br/english/institutional/), ranked as the leading university in Latin America [#92 QS World University Ranking](https://www.topuniversities.com/world-university-rankings?page=3). I conduct research within the Safety Analysis Group under the supervision of Prof. Paulo Sérgio Cugnasca and Prof. Alexandre Moreira Nascimento. My work focuses on enhancing the safety and optimization of autonomous systems, with the aim of creating reliable technologies capable of making safe decisions under uncertainty. My long-term goal is to accelerate the adoption of safe and reliable autonomous systems, from robotic manipulators to autonomous vehicles, particularly in robotics and cyber-physical applications, and extend their societal benefits globally.


I obtained my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from the [Polytechnic School](https://www-poli-usp-br.translate.goog/?_x_tr_sl=pt&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=pt-BR&_x_tr_pto=wapp) of the University of São Paulo, where I graduated among the top 10% of my class. During my undergraduate studies, I developed a robust safety investigation framework for safety-critical systems using autonomous vehicles as a case study, which led to award-winning projects recognized for advancing critical scenario generation and fault injection techniques. My current research builds on this foundation, integrating cutting-edge simulation tools such as CARLA and Scenic with hardware-in-the-loop systems using platforms like Arduino and FPGA to bridge the gap between simulation and real-world applications.

<!-- My research interests include Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Robotics, and Simulation, with a focus on practical and scalable solutions. My projects have been supported by renowned institutions, including [CNPq](https://www-gov-br.translate.goog/mcti/pt-br?_x_tr_sl=pt&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=pt-BR&_x_tr_pto=wapp), [FDTE](https://www-fdte-org-br.translate.goog/?_x_tr_sl=pt&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=pt-BR&_x_tr_pto=wapp), and [Itaú-Unibanco (Data Science Center)](https://c2d-poli-usp-br.translate.goog/?_x_tr_sl=pt&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=pt-BR&_x_tr_pto=wapp). Through these efforts, I aim to contribute to the development of safe, accessible, and efficient autonomous technologies, inspired by a legacy of innovation and societal progress. My vision is to advance robotics and autonomous systems as transformative solutions, fostering collaboration and accessibility to address critical societal challenges. -->
